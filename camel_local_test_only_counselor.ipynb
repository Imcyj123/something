      "Counselor: It's important to recognize that these thoughts are not necessarily accurate reflections of who you are. Have you noticed any patterns or triggers that seem to bring on these thoughts more frequently? \n",

      "Counselor: I appreciate your honesty, Nick. It's clear that these thoughts are causing you a lot of distress. How do you think we might start to address and challenge these thoughts together? \n",
      "\n",
      "Counselor: That's a great start. We can work on reframing these thoughts and finding more balanced perspectives. For instance, when you think about being labeled as a \"geek,\" how might you reframe that thought in a more positive or realistic light? \n",
      "\n",
      "Counselor: Absolutely, Nick. It's important to remember that your interests and talents are a part of who you are, and they don't define your worth as a person. How do you feel about exploring some ways to build on these strengths while also addressing these negative thoughts? \n",

      "Counselor: That's a good plan. Let's also consider how we can incorporate some positive self-talk into your daily routine. By acknowledging and appreciating your strengths, you can start to shift your focus away from these negative labels. Would you be open to trying that? \n",

      "Counselor: It sounds like you're ready to make some positive changes, Nick. We'll take this step by step. Remember, you're not alone in this process, and it's okay to reach out for support when you need it. How do you feel about setting some small, achievable goals for our next session? \n",
      "\n",
      "Counselor: Great. Let's start with one small goal for this week. How about we focus on identifying and challenging one negative thought that arises during your daily activities? We can discuss how it went in our next session. Does that sound doable? \n",

      "Counselor: I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress, Nick. Remember, every small step counts, and we'll work together to build on your strengths and address these challenges. See you next time. \n",

      "Counselor: I see. It seems like these thoughts are quite persistent. Can you describe a recent situation where you felt particularly labeled or judged by others? \n",
